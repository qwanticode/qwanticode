## Introduction
👋 Hi there!

I'm Stephane, a passionate full-stack developer specializing in React. I have a degree in software architecture engineering and I love (among other things) everything related to computing, the web, new technologies (to some extent), and science.

For me, the quality of products is paramount, and I invest my professional skills and personal qualities in every mission I undertake.

My ambition? To put my skills at the service of a technological evolution that meets current needs, while respecting ethical values and being responsible for the impact it may have on the future.
